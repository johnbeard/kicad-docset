# KiCad DocSet

This is a docset for KiCad source code. This should be compatible with [Zeal][].

## Feeds

Generally, you can just add the relevant feed from the current Git HEAD,
which will refer to the most recent docset. If you want a feed for a specific
version, they are also archive in the releases.

These are the current feeds, which will update as new versions are released:

* Main docs
** `master`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnbeard/kicad-docset/master/feeds/KiCad-master.xml

## Updates

These docsets are not updated automatically. If you need a new release, open an issue.

In future, perhaps these can be provided by the KiCad CI services.
